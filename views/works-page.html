              <p class="card-text">Al-Khwarizmi’s other important contribution was algebra, a word derived from the title of a mathematical text he published in about 830 called “Al-Kitab al-mukhtasar fi hisab al-jabr wa’l-muqabala” (“The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing”). Al-Khwarizmi wanted to go from the specific problems considered by the Indians and Chinese to a more general way of analyzing problems, and in doing so he created an abstract mathematical language which is used across the world today.</p>

          <h5 class="card-title">Geography</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Al-Khwarizmi was then appointed by the Caliph Al-Ma’mun to head a consortium of 70 Muslim scholars to determine the length of a degree of latitude. The end result would be Al-Khwarizmi’s third major body of work: Kitab Surat Al-Ard (Book on the Appearance of the Earth) which was finished in 833. It is a revised and completed version of Ptolemy’s Geography, consisting of a list of 2402 coordinates of cities and other geographical features.</p>
          <p class="card-text">wooden rods as measures, the Caliph’s scholars travelled a north-south road until they saw a change of one degree in the elevation of the pole star. Their measurements resulted in an amazingly accurate figure for the earth’s circumference: 41,526 kilometres, or 22,422 nautical miles—the equivalent of 115.35 kilometres per degree. Source.</p>
          <p class="card-text">There is only one surviving copy of Kitab Surat Al-Ard, which is kept at the Strasbourg University Library. A Latin translation is kept at the Biblioteca Nacional de España in Madrid. The complete title translates as Book of the Appearance of the Earth, with its Cities, Mountains, Seas, all the Islands and Rivers, Written by Abu Ja’far Muhammad Ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi, According to the Geographical Treatise Written by Ptolemy the Claudian.</p>
