              <p class="card-text">     Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi was a Persian Shi'a Muslim mathematician, astronomer, astrologer and geographer. He was born in Persia of that time around 780  and he died around 850. We have a little true knowledge about the life of Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi. Historians have different interpretations on his life and the origin of his name al-Khwarizmi.
                On that time, Harun al-Rashid became the fifth Caliph of the Abbasid dynasty in 786. He  ruled from his court, in the capital city of Baghdad, over the Islamic empire which stretched from the Mediterranean to India. He brought culture to his court and tried to establish intellectual disciplines, which at that time were not flourishing. Harun died in 809.
                 There was an armed conflict between his two sons al-Amin and al-Mamun. Al Mamun finally became Caliph and ruled the empire from Baghdad. He continued the patronage of learning and founded an academy called “the House of Wisdom” where Greek philosophical and scientific works were translated. He built up a library of manuscripts, the first major library to be set up since that of Alezandria, collecting important works from Bysantium.
                Al-Khwarizmi was scholar in the House of Wisdom in Baghdad. His task was the translation of Greek scientific manuscripts. He also studied and wrote many books and treatises.</p>
